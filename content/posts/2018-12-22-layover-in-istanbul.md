After I graduated from college, I decided to take a 3-day layover in Istanbul before I headed home. I landed at the airport and went straight to the hotel I was staying in. It was pretty cold and dark and I was tired of all the traveling so I called it a day.

The next day I woke up and went to a place that served Turkish coffee. Turks seem to take their breakfast very seriously and I would highly recommend trying as many different breakfast food as possible.

The breakfast itself is a bunch of things and they all taste incredible. This is one of the places off Anthony Bourdain's 'No Reservations'.

Later I went to see Hagia Sofia and the Blue Mosque. The Mosque was still under construction from the inside.

Hagia Sofia looks beautiful but it was too crowded and just felt like a lot of
effort to go through to see inside. I skipped that part of the tour.

I also went to the Grand Bazaar and I spent hours roaming around looking at all the pretty things. I got a few souvenirs and stuff to take back with me. Highly highly recommended!

I visited a few more places here and there but I mostly stayed on the European side of Istanbul. Oh also worth mentioning, Istanbul is the only city in the world which spans two continents. Here's a bridge that connects Europe and Asia.
